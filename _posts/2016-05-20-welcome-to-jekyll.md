# What are Macarons?

Macarons are an exquisite French cookie sandwiched with delicious buttercream.

# Macarons vs. Macaroons

Chances are, you've heard both of these names before, but take note: They are not the same food. Macaroons are coconut chocolate mounds that are common in the UK. Fun fact: Both desserts originated in Italy, but they were both popularized in different countries.

# French Macaron Recipe

Making macarons can be tricky, but with patience and precision, you can create these delightful treats at home.

## Ingredients

### For the Shells:
- 100g almond flour
- 100g powdered sugar
- 75g egg whites (room temperature)
- 75g granulated sugar
- Food coloring (optional)

### For the Filling:
- 100g unsalted butter (softened)
- 150g powdered sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract (or flavor of your choice)

## Instructions

### For the Shells:
1. **Prepare the Dry Ingredients**: Sift the almond flour and powdered sugar together into a bowl. Discard any large pieces.
2. **Make the Meringue**: In a clean, dry bowl, whip the egg whites until foamy. Gradually add the granulated sugar and continue whipping until stiff peaks form. Add food coloring if desired.
3. **Macaronage**: Gently fold the dry ingredients into the meringue in batches. The batter should flow like lava and form a ribbon when lifted with a spatula.
4. **Pipe the Shells**: Transfer the batter to a piping bag fitted with a round tip. Pipe small circles onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat.
5. **Rest the Shells**: Let the piped shells rest at room temperature for 30-60 minutes until a skin forms on the surface.
6. **Bake**: Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C). Bake the shells for 15-18 minutes. Let them cool completely before removing from the baking sheet.

### For the Filling:
1. **Make the Buttercream**: Beat the softened butter until creamy. Gradually add powdered sugar and vanilla extract, mixing until smooth.
2. **Assemble the Macarons**: Pair shells of similar size. Pipe a small amount of filling onto one shell and sandwich it with another.

### Tips:
- Store macarons in an airtight container in the fridge for 24 hours to let the flavors mature.
- Bring to room temperature before serving.

Enjoy your homemade French macarons!
