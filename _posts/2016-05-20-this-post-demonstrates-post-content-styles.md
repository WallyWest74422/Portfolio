# The Best Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe

These chocolate chip cookies are soft, chewy, and loaded with chocolate chips. Perfect for any occasion!

## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups (280g) all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 cup (226g) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
- 3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup (160g) packed brown sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 2 cups (340g) semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.
2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. **Combine Wet Ingredients**: In a large bowl, mix the melted butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth. Add the vanilla extract and eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
4. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients**: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix.
5. **Add Chocolate Chips**: Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed.
6. **Scoop and Bake**: Scoop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers look slightly underbaked.
7. **Cool**: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Tips for Perfect Cookies

- Use room-temperature eggs for better mixing.
- Chill the dough for 30 minutes if you want thicker cookies.
- Store cookies in an airtight container for up to a week.

Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies!
